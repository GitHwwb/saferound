      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <h3>What Permissions Does SafeRound Request?</h3>
      <p>SafeRound requests the following permissions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>View and edit your spreadsheets in Google Sheets™</strong> (<code>/auth/spreadsheets.currentonly</code>) — Required so the add-on can read selected ranges, apply rounding logic, and write adjusted values back to your spreadsheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Access to specific files you use with this app in Google Drive™</strong> (<code>/auth/drive.file</code>) — Allows SafeRound to operate only on spreadsheets you explicitly open and use with the add-on. It does not provide access to other files in your Google Drive™.</li>
        <li><strong>Display custom interfaces inside Google Sheets™</strong> (<code>/auth/script.container.ui</code>) — Enables SafeRound to open a sidebar interface where you can select ranges, choose rounding options, and run the tool. No personal data is collected through this interface.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What Data Does SafeRound Access or Store?</h3>
      <p>SafeRound only processes the data you select in your sheet while using the add-on. It does not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collect, store, or share any personal or spreadsheet data externally</li>
        <li>Use external servers or third-party APIs</li>
        <li>Track user behavior or collect analytics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All processing happens within the Google Sheets™ environment and is performed locally using Google Apps Script.</p>

      <h3>How Is My Data Used?</h3>
      <p>Data from your spreadsheet is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Temporarily read for rounding and total preservation logic</li>
        <li>Written back into your sheet based on the output method you choose (e.g., overwrite or new sheet)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once the operation is complete, no data is retained.</p>

      <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
      <p>We may update this policy if the app's functionality or permissions change. Significant updates will be noted within the add-on or on our landing page.</p>
